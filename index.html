<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic computing
  concepts and tools including program design, plotting, functions, loops and 
  conditionals.  Participants will be encouraged to help one 
  another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. 
</p>
<p align="center">

    For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper
    "<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>".

<!--
  AUDIENCE
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course  is aimed at all academic levels from undergraduate to senior faculty. 
  <strong>No prior programming experience is expected or required.</strong> 
  We will create a supportive environment in which instructors and helpers assist with 
  programming exercises and participants help one another. For this reason on-site 
  (rather than remote) participation is required.
</p>

  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must bring a laptop with
  a few specific software packages installed (listed
  <a href="#setup">below</a>). If you are using a lab-owned machine 
  <strong>please have these installed by IT <i>before</i> the course</strong>. IT can 
  install required software quickly and easily, but your instructors will not be able to 
  do so. Participants are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

  ETHERPAD

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.
